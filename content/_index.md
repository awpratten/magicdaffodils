Meet noise-makers: Alex Schmoll, Warren Pratten, Art Pratten, Richard Moule, Bernie Koenig, and Cailen Dye.

Born of frustration with the pandemic lock-down and disinformation, misinformation, bad news, bad choices, bad ethics, and bad actors in 2020, six musical friends got together and thought the answer to all that noise just might be more noise. Magic Daffodils was born in London, Ontario. Given the state of world affairs today, noise might be more relevant than ever. 


Alex Schmoll, with his passion for sound design, is behind the synthesizer backbone of the band&#39;s music. His melodies and complex textures are a canvas for the rest of the band to build upon.

Warren Pratten, on guitar, creates hypnotic riffs and soundscapes that weave in and out of the music. His playing is both technical and soulful, providing a depth to the band&#39;s sound.

Art Pratten, a founding member of the legendary Nihilist Spasm Band, brings his unconventional instrument, the Pratt-a-various, to the table. With its chaotic, unpredictable sound, the Pratt-a-various adds a layer of unpredictability to the band&#39;s music that keeps the listener on their toes.

Richard Moule, a fellow synth enthusiast, is a master of atmospheric, ambient sounds that transport the listener.  His immersive soundscapes bring depth and form.

Bernie Koenig&#39;s drumming is the rhythmic core, but goes beyond mere timekeeping.  His percussion skills to add a sense of urgency and tension to the music.

Cailen Dye&#39;s bass playing ties everything together, providing a solid foundation for the band&#39;s music while also adding depth and complexity to the overall sound.

Together, Alex, Warren, Art, Richard, Bernie, and Cailen push the boundaries of what experimental music can be. Whether performing live or in the studio, Magic Daffodils are sure to captivate and inspire with their unique blend of sound and creativity.
