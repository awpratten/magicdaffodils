Magic Daffodils is a group of London Ontario musicians who are keen to collaborate and produce original music.   Our music is freely improvised with virtually no prior discussion other than the occasional direction for one of us to "start something".   The resulting music varies quite a bit, even within a single piece, and can be described as oscillating between free noise and ambience.

 

Magic Daffodils consists of a diverse group of musicians, all with a long history in the London music scene:

    Alex Schmoll - Synths. Electronic Gadgets and FX
    Art Pratten - Pratt-o-various
    Bernie Koenig - Drums and Vibes
    Calien Dye - Bass and FX
    Richard Moule - Synths, Samples and FX
    Warren Pratten - Guitars and FX

 

 

Magic Daffodils can trace their origin back to a long standing collaboration between Cailen and Alex (see Hidden Dances).   In 20??, Cailen and Alex began collaborating with Richard and Bernie.  Originally at Alex's studio and later during the height of COVID physical isolation, playing outside at Alex's farm.   Art was invited to join the group in 2020 and Warren  was invited to join in 2021.
